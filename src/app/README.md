# app structure (you can delete this file)

This folder can serve as the home for the components that define the structure of your application.

### Consider creating a folder structure for each component as such:

| Container/
  | index.ts - entry point into this component, export anything that needs to be exported here.
  | Container.tsx - The app component file for react code.
  | Container.test.tsx - Jest tests for the Container component if applicable.
